# Alpaca_API_Assignment
This repo contains the Unit 5 Homework Assignment: Financial Planning. In this assignment I am demonstrating the skills that I have learned and practiced during the APIs unit of this course. The objective of this assignment is to create a personal finance planner that "allows users to visualize their savings composed by investments in shares and cryptocurrencies to assess if they have enough money as an emergency fund" and to create a "retirement planning tool that will use the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio composed of stocks and bonds, then run Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years. You will then use the Monte Carlo data to calculate the expected portfolio returns given a specific initial investment amount." This assignment showcases my abilities to use the alpacas api and extract data real time of prices of stocks and cryptocurrencies and utilize that data to create dataframes and conduct financial calculations. This assignment also demonstrates my ability to conduct Monte Carlo simulations and have visual represntations (graphs) of the data that is being calculated.
